# Tartu-data
There are a total of 3 tasks divided between sets of Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a different aspect of mapping/analyzing. Those 3 tasks are 1) mapping the bus data 2) mapping the bike data 3)graphing the bus data (bus data analysis). Each notebook has a separate read-me file, that informs the user about the notebook in more detail.  
IMPORTANT INFORMATION: to open the bike data mapping notebook, Jupiter notebook has to be opened specially. The way I did it was by opening the Anaconda Prompt and entering the following line:  
jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=1.0e10
